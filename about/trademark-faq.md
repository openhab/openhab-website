Third parties providing products or services that are supersets of the functionality of openHAB, or services that run atop openHAB, may use the phrase "Powered by openHAB". For example, "BigCo SuperThing, Powered by openHAB" would be acceptable, provided that you meet all of the other requirements:

 - Any primary product home pages or landing pages must include a link from the homepage pointing to the openHAB project home page at https://www.openHAB.org/.
- Do not visually combine the "Powered by openHAB" logo with any other images, or change the logo in any way other than ways required by printing restrictions.
- On your website link any "Powered by openHAB" logo to the homepage of the openHAB project.
- Ensure that your website and marketing materials do not imply the openHAB Foundation's endorsement or the affiliation of your products, services, or organization with the openHAB Foundation or project.
- Ensure that your website and marketing materials do not confuse the average user about the source of openHAB or imply that openHAB is associated with your products or services in any way, other than the fact that your product is built atop/to work with openHAB product.

## What should I do if I have questions about the trademark policy?

If you have any questions about the use of the openHAB trademark or logo, please contact the Foundation at trademarks@openhabfoundation.org.
