openHAB is a community effort and everyone can take part in that.
Be it by being an active developer, a bug reporter, a writer or translator, or making monetary contributions, here's an overview on how you can get involved!


### Help Others

openHAB can be intimidating to new users, and even experienced ones might encounter a problem you can solve. If you are knowledgeable in openHAB or one of its related technologies, you are very much encouraged to share your insights in the [community forum](https://community.openhab.org).



### Contribute Code

You might want to fix a bug, add a feature, or write a new add-on. That's awesome!

The [Developer Guide](/docs/developer) has everything to get you started.



### Report Issues

Before reporting an issue, please check the [community forum](https://community.openhab.org) for solutions and help.
More people will see your issue when it is posted in the forum and community members may be able to help you find known solutions/workarounds.

When no solution was found, use the table below to determine where your issue should be reported:

Issue | Where to report
------|----------------
Problems and feature requests for openHAB 2 add-ons | [openhab-addons](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/issues)
Issues related to the runtime environment, IDE and packaging | [openhab-distro](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/issues)
Issues related to the core openHAB bundles that are not from Eclipse SmartHome | [openhab-core](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/issues)

But do not worry - if you are not clear, which category your issue belongs to - we will redirect you, if necessary.

Please pay attention to the respective `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in all of these repositories.
They include further details on how to report an issue or file a pull request.



### Translate

openHAB has several projects on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/openhab-bot) - if you are native or fluent in another language, you can help!



### Write Documentation

Our docs are always getting better, but we use all the help we can. Whether it's fixing a typo or writing new articles, our [documentation repository](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-docs) is ready to welcome your contributions!



### Sponsor Development
