<h2 class="big-title">Thank you for supporting openHAB!</h2>

Since 2016, the [openHAB Foundation e.V.](https://www.openhabfoundation.org) is a non-profit organisation that
promotes the project and the use of open, vendor-agnostic solutions to empower your smart home in all possible ways:

- Organizing events such as the [Smart Home Day](/blog/2017-10-22-smarthomeday-ece.html);
- Running this website on behalf of the project and dealing with marketing and media;
- Maintaining the [build server](https://ci.openhab.org/) and the repositories of [release binaries](https://openhab.jfrog.io/);
- Hosting a [demo server](https://demo.openhab.org/) for new users to try openHAB;
- Keeping the [community forum](https://community.openhab.org/) server up and running;
- Running the free-of-charge [myopenHAB](https://community.openhab.org/) service, an openHAB Cloud instance
  allowing 20000+ registered users to easily and securely access their smart home remotely, and connect them to the cloud;
- Taking care of the publication of the apps in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openhab.habdroid),
  the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/openhab/id492054521) and the
  [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/openhab/9nmq39ctwxgt);
- Making sure openHAB has a presence on various external platforms such as [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/openhab)
  and [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/openHAB-Foundation/dp/B01MTY7Z5L);
- and [more](/blog/2016-12-15-openhabfdn-takeoff.html)!

Everything has a cost, and while you're enjoying these services for free, running them with no commercial intent is not. Your donations help
a lot and are used solely for extending the goals of the Foundation. If you find these efforts useful, please consider donating what
you think they are worth.
