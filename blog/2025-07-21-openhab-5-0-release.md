# Activity

As you'd expect from any new openHAB release, we have had a high activity across all our GitHub repositories.
We therefore want to share a few statistics about our three main repositories: Core, add-ons, and UIs.

[openHAB Core](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core) has received xxx pull requests in total, with xxx bug fixes and xxx enhancements resulting in xx,yyy lines of added code.

xx new add-ons, xxx bug fixes and xxx enhancements were contributed in xxx pull requests to the [openHAB add-ons repository](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons), which resulted in the addition of xxx,yyy lines of code.

Our [openHAB web UIs](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui) have received xxx pull requests, including xxx bug fixes and xxx enhancements resulting in xx,yyy lines of code added.

It is worth mentioning that [our other repositories](https://github.com/openhab) have also received numerous contributions (e.g. documentation), but listing them all would probably be too much here.
Many thanks to all our contributors for driving openHAB forward!

Again, it is time to shout out to our top code contributors per repository (having done the most commits) for this new release:

- TODO

Many of our top committers are also maintainers, which means besides contributing code, they also review pull requests and participate in discussions on GitHub issues, which helps maintain our high level of quality across bindings, UIs and Core.
At present, we have xx maintainers across all our repositories.
Huge thanks to all our contributors and all my maintainer colleagues for their work on our next major release!

# Highlights

As you might have already noticed in the activity statistics, there was much development on openHAB - too much to list everything.
Please refer to the [**release notes**](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/5.0.0) to check out what's new and noteworthy (e.g. breaking changes).

In the following sections, our maintainers and contributors are introducing some new features you don't want to miss!

## Matter Integration

_Dan Cunningham ([@digitaldan](https://github.com/digitaldan)), openHAB Maintainer_

## Python Scripting

_Holger Hees ([@HolgerHees](https://github.com/HolgerHees)), openHAB Maintainer_

Our new major release introduces a new [Python Scripting add-on](/addons/automation/pythonscripting) based on [GraalPy](https://www.graalvm.org/python/).
Unlike the [Jython Scripting add-on](/addons/automation/jythonscripting), it offers full Python 3.11 support and is future-proof, as the underlying [GraalPy](https://www.graalvm.org/python/) is actively developed and promoted by Oracle.
In the long term, it will also completely replace the _outdated_ Jython add-on, but before, Jython will be market as deprecated for a while.

The binding offers the possibility of using Python as a scripting language in UI or file-based rules, as well as in transformation services.
It also included a helper library that simplifies the use of openHAB's API and provides a more Pythonic interface to interact with openHAB's APIs.

It also offers the following improvements over the Jython binding:

- improved error logging
- import native `java.*` or `org.openhab.*` Java packages
- scope module to encapsulate all jsr223 objects
- rule class to simplify rule setup, logging, and more
- registry class which wraps/simplifies access to Items, Things, Channels
- works with native python datatypes like [`datetype`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) instead of [`ZonedDateTime`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/time/ZonedDateTime.html)
- all kinds of triggers, actions and services are supported
- object functions are almost 100% similar to the openHAB Core API
- dependency watcher to reload scripts when modified

The only current limitation is the lack of PIP support for installing external modules, which will be introduced in the next release.
If you don't want to wait, you can install [the beta version via the Marketplace](https://community.openhab.org/t/python-scripting-5-0-0-5-9-9/164947).

It's also important to note that this binding was not developed as a replacement for HabAPP, which is completely independent, still actively developed, and enjoys a large community.
Your choice among these two options depends entirely on your personal preference.

## Z-Wave JS Binding

_Leo Siepel ([@lsiepel](https://github.com/lsiepel)), openHAB Maintainer_

The openHAB 5.0 release introduces a new [Z-Wave JS binding](/addons/bindings/zwavejs), offering an alternative way to integrate Z-Wave networks into openHAB by connecting to an external [Z-Wave JS](https://zwave-js.github.io/zwave-js/) server.
This binding is particularly useful for advanced users, large networks, or those seeking cross-platform compatibilityâ€”such as when migrating from or running alongside other home automation platforms.
It supports newer 700/800 series chipsets, S2 security, Smart Start, and provides more robust device management features.
While the binding does not yet expose every capability of [Z-Wave JS](https://zwave-js.github.io/zwave-js/) (such as NVM backups), these can be accessed via the [Z-Wave JS UI](https://zwave-js.github.io/zwave-js-ui/) directly.
Importantly, the existing native Z-Wave binding remains fully supported, giving users the flexibility to choose the integration that best fits their needs.

More information and discussion can be found on the community forum: [Z-Wave JS UI in place of openHAB Z-Wave binding](https://community.openhab.org/t/zwave-js-ui-in-place-of-oh-zwave-binding/150007)

## Core Runtime Enhancements

### Scripted Item, Metadata, Item-Channel-Link & Thing Providers

_Florian Hotze ([@florian-h05](https://github.com/florian-h05)), openHAB Maintainer_

openHAB 5.0 introduces a new _provider_ script extension that allows scripts to provide Items, Metadata, Item-Channel-Links and Things from scripts through special registry delegates and wrappers.
This powerful new feature allows you to create them in a configuration as code style, which is especially useful for advanced users who want to manage their openHAB configuration in a more programmatic way.
The core runtime handles the lifecycle of them for you, they are automatically created, updated and deleted when the script is reloaded or removed.

We are currently working on implementing this in the JavaScript helper library, which will provide an easy-to-use JavaScript API to those new core features.
Stay tuned for the next [openhab-js release](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-js) to get started with this new feature from your JavaScript scripts!

## Main UI Enhancements

_Florian Hotze ([@florian-h05](https://github.com/florian-h05)), openHAB Maintainer_

### Sitemap Editor Drag & Drop

When designing sitemaps through the UI, it was very cumbersome to move elements around, as you had to delete and re-add them in the desired order, or cut and paste the DSL code in the code tab.
With openHAB 5.0, we have introduced a drag and drop feature to the sitemap editor, allowing you to easily rearrange elements in the sitemap:

<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/uploads/2025-07-21-openhab-5-0-release/sitemap-edit-dragdrop.gif"/></p>

Many thanks to Mark Herwege ([@mherwege](https://github.com/mherwege)) for implementing this feature!

### Model Editor Drag & Drop

Similarly to the sitemap editor, the model editor now supports drag and drop for moving semantic tags around.
This not only makes it faster to build your semantic model, it also makes it easier to ensure that your model is valid and follows the best practices by introducing numerous validation checks.

<div align="center" class="row">
  <img style="max-width: 45%; min-width: 250px;" src="/uploads/2025-07-21-openhab-5-0-release/model-dragdrop-1.gif"/>
  <img style="max-width: 45%; min-width: 250px;" src="/uploads/2025-07-21-openhab-5-0-release/model-dragdrop-2.gif"/>
</div>

A big thank you to Mark Herwege ([@mherwege](https://github.com/mherwege)) for working on this game-changing feature!

### Regenerate Rules from Templates

### Copy DSL & YAML Definitions

### State Series chart

_Jeff James ([@jsjames](https://github.com/jsjames)), openHAB Contributor_

In openHAB 5.0, we have added a new chart series type for time-based charts to easily see changes of an Item's state over time.
It is especially useful for Items that have a limited set of states, such as _ON_ and _OFF_, or _OPEN_ and _CLOSED_, but can also be used for Items with more complex states, such as _Air Temp State_ vs. _Air Temp_ in the example below.
The new [`oh-state-series`](/docs/ui/components/oh-state-series.html) supports several settings to adjust colour palette and the ability to provide a function to map item states (see _Air Temp State_ vs. _Air Temp_ in the example below).
This series can be used on any time-based chart with either an `oh-value-axis` or `oh-category-axis` as the y-axis.

<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/uploads/2025-07-21-openhab-5-0-release/oh-state-series.png"/></p>

### Semantic Tags Maintenance & Treeview Picker

openHAB 4.1 introduced the ability to extend the semantic model with custom tags through a YAML configuration file.
In openHAB 5.0, we have added support for maintaining these custom tags through the UI.

The developer tools now include a new _Semantic Tags_ section, where you can view, edit, and delete your custom tags.
This section also allows you to check the structure of the semantic tags and their relationships, making it easier to understand the concept of the semantic model and how to use it effectively.
It features both a treeview and a code tab, allowing you to switch between a visual representation and the underlying YAML code.

<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/uploads/2025-07-21-openhab-5-0-release/semantic-tags-maintenance.webp"/></p>

In addition to the maintenance page, the semantics picker in the Item editor has been updated to use the treeview, making it easier to select the correct semantic tag for your Items by visualising the hierarchy of tags:

<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/uploads/2025-07-21-openhab-5-0-release/semantic-tags-picker.gif"/></p>

Again, a big thank you to Mark Herwege ([@mherwege](https://github.com/mherwege))!

### Additional Enhancements

- **Widget Config:** The widget config popup has been redesigned to support live updates, dirty checking and be movable, so you can watch the changes in your page while editing the widget config.
- **Specific Browser Titles:** The browser title now reflects the current page, making it easier to identify the contents of the openHAB tabs in your browser.
- **Log Viewer Enhancements:** The log viewer has been enhanced with a history buffer, allowing you to scroll back through previous log entries, and a log details popup that provides more information about each log entry.
  Additionally, a text mode has been introduced as alternative to the default table view, having the look and feel of the well-known [frontail](https://github.com/mthenw/frontail) log viewer.
- **Thing Inbox:** Add search, approve multiple Things at once and allow to change Thing ID & label when approving Things.

## Blockly Enhancements

- New Rule-Enable Block to enable or disable rules.
- New dictionary block to update dictionary entry values
- Persistence Block: Riemann sum support added
- Boolean-typed variable added
- Get Item Previous State added

## Sitemap Enhancements

### MQTT Home Assistant Binding

_Cody Cutrer ([@ccutrer](https://github.com/ccutrer)), openHAB Maintainer_

On the subject of Python, the GraalVM work has enabled the Home Assistant MQTT binding to switch from using the Java Jinjava library for emulating Python's Jinja to actually running Python and Jinja.
This allows openHAB to import some of the actual Home Assistant Python code, so template rendering from devices should be near-perfect, without constantly playing a game of catch-up as we find devices that use some feature of Python, Jinja, or Home Assistant that we hadn't previously conceived of.

We've also taken this one step further, and re-implemented parsing of the Home Assistant JSON discovery metadata via Home Assistant's own classes, which fixes myriad strange bugs and incompatibilities from attempting to implement in Java using only Home Assistant documentation as a guide.
We now get the benefit of exactly matching many of those minor idiosyncrasies that aren't documented.
There's still work to do in the portion of the binding that connects incoming data to openHAB channels.
However, it's now sitting on a much stronger base so that any issues there can be more quickly iterated on and fixed.
