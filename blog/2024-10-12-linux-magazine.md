## Introducing openHAB in the Linux Magazine

I am excited to share my openHAB introduction article in the Linux Magazine, explaining the basic concepts of openHAB, briefly reviewing its history and guiding step-by-step through installation and first setup!

### Why You Should Read It

Whether you are curious about home automation and openHAB or an openHAB-expert, I recommend reading my article!

Together, we will learn about the core concepts of openHAB like Things, Items and Rules and take a look at openHAB's history.
If you already know the few concepts just mentioned, let me ask you: Can you tell the difference between rules, scenes and scripts?
And do you know openHAB has been an official Eclipse project?

If you are a home automation novice, the article is even more rewarding to read:
After installing openHAB, I will guide you through the initial setup, adding free weather forecast from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) and astronomical data calculated by the Astro binding to your openHAB installation, leveraging the semantic model and setting up the UI.
Next, a short introduction into rules helps you to setup the automation required to make a smart home out of a connected home.
Last but not least you will setup remote access through [myopenHAB](https://www.myopenhab.org), which allows you to access openHAB even when away from home and provides the necessary cloud service for push notifications.

### Where to Find It

The English version of the article can be purchased from the [website of the American Linux Magazine](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2024/288/openHAB) or read in the November issue #288/2024 of the Linux Magazine.

The German version has been published a few weeks earlier in the September issue 09/2024 of the German Linux Magazin (also available on [Readly](https://de.readly.com)) and can be read for free on the [website of the German Linux Magazin](https://www.linux-magazin.de/ausgaben/2024/09/openhab/).
