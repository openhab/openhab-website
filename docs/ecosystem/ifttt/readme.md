# IFTTT Integration for openHAB

<div class="img-wrapper"><img src='./images/ifttt-meets-openhab.jpg' alt='IFTTT meets openHAB'/></div>

openHAB users can take advantage of IFTTT to realize even more use cases in their smart home!

## What is IFTTT?

[If This Then That (IFTTT)](https://ifttt.com) is a very popular web-based service that allows users to create "applets", which can combine different web services into powerful automation rules.

## Why use openHAB with IFTTT?

openHAB already integrates with [far more than 200 different smart home technologies](/addons). While there are some web services like Twitter available, this is not the primary integration focus of openHAB. Therefore IFTTT perfectly complements the features of openHAB: With its [hundreds of channels](https://ifttt.com/channels), there are limitless new creative options: Be notified through text-to-speech if you are receive a DM on twitter, be warned through your lights if your favorite stock price falls below a certain threshold or put your house in away-mode when you turn on the ignition of your car - you can get further inspiration by browsing through existing applets.

Besides the new kinds of integration possibilities, IFTTT is also a perfect start for new openHAB users as it makes the creation of rules dead simple - no need to do any scripting, no complex setup routines, it all works through a few mouse clicks!

We have also integrated with IFTTTâ€™s [Do Button](https://ifttt.com/products/do/button). The Do button allows you to access often required functionality very quickly - either through the Do app, as a widget or even as a floating button, that is always present on your screen.

## Let's Go!

IFTTT is available to all our users through the [myopenHAB service](http://www.myopenhab.org/). Once you have your myopenHAB account set up, all you have to do is to decide, which items you want to share with IFTTT and to activate the openHAB channel.
