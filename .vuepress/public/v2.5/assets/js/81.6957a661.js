In addition to openHAB we will introduce you to MQTT, tell you what it is, and show you how you can adopt this highly flexible communication protocol and integrate “things” with openHAB.  Participants use an ESP8266 preloaded with a small program for lab work with openHAB and MQTT.  Our focus will be for the “Intranet” of things, i.e. we will concentrate on keeping openHAB unreacheable from the Internet, but we will talk about accessing data on the Internet.\n")])])])}],!1,null,null,null);e.default=a.exports}}]);
